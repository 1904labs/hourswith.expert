Files as far as the eye could see. Data in CSV and XML. Then Excel came along. If you were fancy you had mainframes.\nThen came the relational database renaissance. Everyone writes SQL and puts all their data in Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.\nNext people wanted to consolidate all their data into a Data Warehouse. MPP platforms like Teradata, Netezza, and Oracle DW.\nHadoop burst onto the scene with cluster computing. Hadoop distributed file system. Map Reduce\nCloud offered a new way with managed services. Separation of storage and compute.\nMPP - Massively Parallel Processing SQL - Structured Query Language NoSQL - Literally No SQL or “Not Only SQL”. Examples include key/value stores like Redis, wide column dbs like Cassandra and HBase.\nVolume - The quantity of generated and stored data. Big Data is typically when you have so much data you can’t store/process it effectively on one machine\nVariety - The type and nature of the data. Example: files like CSV, structured data in databases, audio, videos, sensor readings, logs\nVelocity - the speed at which the data is generated and processed Batch (once a day, import a file into the database), Streaming 24/7 process transactions looking for fraud\nVariability - Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it. Do the values in the dataset mean the same thing? Example: free text notes field where someone enters a value, email addresses, names\nVeracity - The quality of captured data can vary greatly, Trustworthiness of the data\n"}),a.add({id:1,href:'/docs/getting-started/',title:"Getting Started",section:"Docs",content:"Getting Started #  To run these examples, you need an environment capable of running an IDE (Intellij) Hardware requirements\nInstalling Software #  Intellij - scala Git Maven\nSetup on Mac, Windows, and Linux\nTODO: should we do python?\nInstalling Intellij IDEA on Mac #  Download Intellij IDEA Community Edition\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac\nOpen Intellij From the home screen, click \u0026ldquo;Plugins\u0026rdquo; Find and install the Scala plugin\nEnvironment Variables #  todo: basics of environment variables\nUsing the Command Line #  todo: command line basics for mac/linux/windows\n"}),a.add({id:2,href:'/docs/scala/',title:"Scala",section:"Docs",content:"Scala #  Scala introduction.\nTODO\n"}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/kafka/',title:"Kafka",section:"Docs",content:"Kafka #  Spark introduction.\nTODO\n"}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/spark/',title:"Spark",section:"Docs",content:"Spark #  Spark introduction.\nTODO\n\u0026lt;section id=\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Pages }} {{ .Render \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;}} {{ end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; "}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/spark-and-kafka/',title:"Spark and Kafka",section:"Docs",content:"Using Kafka with Spark #  How to read from Kafka in Spark introduction.\nTODO\n"}),a.add({id:6,href:'/docs/hbase/',title:"HBase",section:"Docs",content:"HBase #  HBase introduction.\nTODO\n"}),a.add({id:7,href:'/docs/spark-and-hbase/',title:"Spark and HBase",section:"Docs",content:"Using HBase with Spark #  How to query HBase from Spark introduction.\nTODO\n"})})()
