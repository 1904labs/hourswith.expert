## Getting Started

Get you and your computer ready!

## Pre-requisites

Data Engineers often work with the command line as part of their job. We'll use the command line a few times
throughout this course. 

 - REQUIRED: Start with the basics ðŸ‘‰ [Command line basics](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)
 - Starting with Kafka, you'll also need to know [How to Set Environment Variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

## Setup your Computer

To run these examples, you need an environment capable of running an IDE (Intellij) which means a modern CPU and
at least 4GB of RAM.

### Installing Software

To start we'll need the following software:
 - Intellij
 - Git

#### Installing Intellij IDEA on Mac

Download Intellij IDEA Community Edition

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac

Open Intellij.

From the home screen, click "Plugins" and go to Marketplace.

Find and install the Scala plugin.

Your mac should come with git already! Check by opening up the terminal and typing

```
git --version
```

If all goes well, you'll see something like this:
