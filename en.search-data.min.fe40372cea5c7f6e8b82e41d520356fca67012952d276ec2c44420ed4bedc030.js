Files as far as the eye could see. Data in CSV and XML. Then Excel came along. If you were fancy you had mainframes.\nThen came the relational database renaissance. Everyone writes SQL and puts all their data in Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.\nNext people wanted to consolidate all their data into a Data Warehouse. MPP platforms like Teradata, Netezza, and Oracle DW.\nHadoop burst onto the scene with cluster computing. Hadoop distributed file system. Map Reduce\nCloud offered a new way with managed services. Separation of storage and compute.\nMPP - Massively Parallel Processing SQL - Structured Query Language NoSQL - Literally No SQL or ‚ÄúNot Only SQL‚Äù. Examples include key/value stores like Redis, wide column dbs like Cassandra and HBase.\nVolume - The quantity of generated and stored data. Big Data is typically when you have so much data you can‚Äôt store/process it effectively on one machine\nVariety - The type and nature of the data. Example: files like CSV, structured data in databases, audio, videos, sensor readings, logs\nVelocity - the speed at which the data is generated and processed Batch (once a day, import a file into the database), Streaming 24/7 process transactions looking for fraud\nVariability - Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it. Do the values in the dataset mean the same thing? Example: free text notes field where someone enters a value, email addresses, names\nVeracity - The quality of captured data can vary greatly, Trustworthiness of the data\n"}),a.add({id:1,href:'/docs/getting-started/',title:"Getting Started",section:"Docs",content:"Getting Started #  Get you and your computer ready!\nPre-requisites #  Data Engineers often work with the command line as part of their job.
